# What's new in Microsoft Graph

See highlights of what's new in the recent two months in Microsoft Graph, [what's added earlier](whats-new-earlier.md), and how you can [share your ideas](#want-to-stay-in-the-loop). For a detailed list of API-level updates, see the [API changelog](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/changelog/). 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Features, including APIs and tools, in _preview_ status may change without notice, and some may never be promoted to generally available (GA) status. Do not use preview features in production apps.

## June 2022: New in preview only

### Education
- [Create](/graph/api/educationassignment-setupfeedbackresourcesfolder?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a SharePoint folder for an [assignment](/graph/api/resources/educationassignment?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) to upload feedback documents.
- [Create](/graph/api/educationfeedbackresourceoutcome-post-outcomes?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a [feedback document](/graph/api/resources/educationFeedbackResourceOutcome?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for a [submission](/graph/api/resources/educationsubmission?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) in the feedback folder associated with the assignment.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
Hide self-service password reset (SSPR) links in the [login page text visibility settings](/graph/api/resources/loginpagetextvisibilitysettings?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for a tenant's sign-in page.


## May 2022: New and generally available

### Education
- [Track changes for assignment](/graph/api/educationassignment-delta) resources.
- [Track changes for assignment category](/graph/api/educationcategory-delta) resources.

### Identity and access | Directory management
An [application](/graph/api/resources/application) registered in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) can specify application or service contact information from a Service or Asset Management database.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
Allow an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant to set up [federation with another organization whose identity provider (IdP) supports either the SAML or WS-Fed protocol](/graph/api/resources/samlOrWsFedExternalDomainFederation). This enables the Azure AD tenant to allow guest users to access its resources.

### Search
You can specify up to 1000 search results per page for a [search request](/graph/api/resources/searchrequest).

### Sites and lists
- Get a collection of [content type](/graph/api/resources/contentType) resources from the content type hub that are compatible by using the [getCompatibleHubContentTypes](/graph/api/contenttype-getcompatiblehubcontenttypes) action. 
- Add or synchronize a content type from the content type hub to a [site](/graph/api/resources/site) or [list](/graph/api/resources/list), by using the [addCopyFromContentTypeHub](/graph/api/contenttype-addcopyfromcontenttypehub) action. This makes a content type or its update available to a specific site or list where it is needed. This is an improvement from the legacy sync infrastructure which pushes the content type to all sites across an organization, reducing wait times for the publishing to propagate. 
- Get one or more [rich, long-running operations](/graph/api/resources/richlongrunningoperation) occurring on a site or list, which can happen when adding a content type synchronously.

### Tasks and plans
- [Get](/graph/api/plannerplandetails-get) or [update](/graph/api/plannerplandetails-update) category descriptions as part of the [details](/graph/api/resources/plannerplandetails) of a [plan](/graph/api/resources/plannerplan).
- Instead of the **owner** property of a **plan**, use the **type** property of a [plan container](/graph/api/resources/plannerplancontainer) to specify authorization rules and the lifetime of a **plan**.
- Get the priority of a [task](/graph/api/resources/plannerTask).

### Teamwork
[Get messages on a channel](/graph/api/channel-list-messages) and [include any replies](/graph/api/channel-list-messages#example-3-request-with-top-and-expand-query-options-on-replies) to the message.

### To-do tasks
- Break down a complex [to-do task](/graph/api/resources/todotask) into more actionable, smaller tasks each as a [checklist item](/graph/api/resources/checklistitem).
- Label a to-do task with a [category](/graph/api/resources/outlookcategory) that is defined by the user to group Outlook contacts, events, messages, group posts, and to-do tasks.


## May 2022: New in preview only

### Application
When configuring Azure AD Application Proxy for on-premises applications for secure remote access, use the **isStateSessionEnabled** property in the [onPremisesPublishing](/graph/api/resources/onPremisesPublishing?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resource to specify whether to validate the state parameter if the application uses the OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow. Setting this property helps administrators to protect the app from cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

### Compliance | Subject rights requests
- Specify or get the locations that should searched in a [subject rights request](/graph/api/resources/subjectRightsRequest?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), such as [mailboxes](/graph/api/resources/subjectRightsRequestAllMailboxLocation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), [SharePoint, OneDrive, or Teams channels](/graph/api/resources/subjectRightsRequestAllSiteLocation?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- Specify or get a KQL-based content query that should be used for search in a subject rights request.

### Device and app management | Cloud PC
- Get a clearly defined [result](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcbulkremoteactionresult?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) upon [bulk-reprovisioning Cloud PC devices](/graph/api/manageddevice-bulkReprovisionCloudPc?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true).
- [Get](/graph/api/manageddevice-getcloudpcreviewstatus?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) or [set](/graph/api/manageddevice-setcloudpcreviewstatus?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) a [Cloud PC review status](/graph/api/resources/cloudpcreviewstatus?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), or [bulk-set Cloud PC review status](/graph/api/manageddevice-bulksetcloudpcreviewstatus?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for multiple devices.

### Device and app management | Multi-tenant management
[Get](/graph/api/managedtenants-managedtenant-list-tenantusage?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the number of monthly active users for each service in a managed tenant.

### Education
Use a [Teams app resource](/graph/api/resources/educationteamsappresource?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) that corresponds to an installed Microsoft Teams app, to allow education service users to create and share assignments with embedded Teams applications, such as YouTube or FlipGrid.

### Identity and access | Directory management
Activating a service [for an organization](/graph/api/organization-activateService?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) and [for a user](/graph/api/user-activateServicePlan?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) are deprecated, and will stop returning data on June 30, 2022.

### Identity and access | Identity and sign-in
As part of the [default user role](/graph/api/resources/defaultuserrolepermissions?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) of an [authorization policy](/graph/api/resources/authorizationPolicy?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true), specify whether the registered owner of a device can read their own BitLocker recovery keys.

### Reports | Identity and access reports
Get a [usage report for a user's registered authentication methods](/graph/api/resources/userregistrationdetails?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) that includes the default method for multi-factor authentication.

### Search | Index
[Get](/graph/api/externalconnectors-connectionquota-get?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) the [quota information](/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-connectionQuota?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) for a [connection](/graph/api/resources/externalconnectors-externalconnection?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true). This information includes the number of items you can ingest into the connection, taking into account items remaining in the connection and the tenant-level remaining quota for all its connections.

### Sites and lists
[Track changes for SharePoint list item](/graph/api/listitem-delta?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) resources.

### Teamwork
- Use application permissions to [get all the chats](/graph/api/chat-list?view=graph-rest-beta&preserve-view=true) that a specified user is involved in without the user being present.
